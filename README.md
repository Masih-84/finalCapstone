Part 2- The final Task(25) of the Hyperion boot-camps course 
This is the last project from the Hyperion Bootcamp.
This is exercise Task-24 of the coding section, which is used from the coding exercises and programs of the exercism.org website. Python coding is used to write the program.
The title of this exercise: Little sister's vocabulary (Learn about strings by helping your little sister with her vocabulary homework.)
In this project, exercises were done to add and subtract prefixes and suffixes to the words of a sentence and to find the root of the verb.
In the text of the codes there are details of how the written program works.
You can add new data from list to the program and get the desired output with the default print or request commands.
The program does not need to be installed and can be implemented through VS Code.
The answer to this exercise is completely written by me.
